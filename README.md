This is a tool that shows notifications for Twitch channel points reward redeems! It was built as an update to other tools that have stopped working. rip.

a moment of silence for the great DXPN - the go to resource for small streamers needing channel point alert pop-ups! until it was rendered un-working by the decomissioning of the twitch pubsub system.. I have tried to re-build and update/improve this tool from the ashes of the fallen. 

It will automatically receive any reward's name, background color and image, and display a pop-up alert notification when it's redeemed on your stream.

The glow and confetti color will be the redeeming user's chat color (:

Simply add it as a browser source by copying the URL after you connect your twitch account!

1920x1080 browser sources work best! the confetti effect scales based on the width of the browser source. So, slimmer browser sources will produce a more condensed stream of confetti! if this is the effect you want try an 800x600 browser source! if you want a wider bar of confetti in the popup, try wider browser sources like 1000px+

I am an artist/tech. not a computer science major. my code is hacky but it works! if you would like to suggest edits, please do!
If this tool has helped you along you way, I am very pleased (;
