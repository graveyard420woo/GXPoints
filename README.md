This is a tool that shows notifications for Twitch channel points reward redeems! It was built as an update to other tools that have stopped working. rip.

a moment of silence for the great DXPN - the go to resource for small streamers needing channel point alert pop-ups! until it was rendered un-working by the decomissioning of the twitch pubsub system.. I have tried to re-build and update/improve this tool from the ashes of the fallen. 

It will automatically receive any reward's name, background color and image, and display a pop-up alert notification when it's redeemed on your stream.

The glow and confetti color will be the redeeming user's chat color (:

Simply add it as a browser source by copying the URL after you connect your twitch account!

<ul>
<li>Once you connect your twitch account, the page will go blank (this is a success)</li>
<li>Test the browser source by redeeming a channel point reward on your connected channel (it will pop up in the blank screen)</li>
<li>Copy the URL from that blank browser window and paste it into a new browser source in OBS/StreamLabs/etc.. Easy!</li>
</ul>

1920x1080 browser sources work best! the confetti effect scales based on the width of the browser source. So, slimmer browser sources will produce a more condensed stream of confetti! if this is the effect you want try an 800x600 browser source! if you want a wider bar of confetti in the popup, try wider browser sources like 1000px+

I am an artist/tech. not a computer science major. my code is hacky but it works! if you would like to suggest edits, please do!
If this tool has helped you along you way, I am very pleased (; Huge ups to DX3006 for paving the way.
